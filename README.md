# SpigotJSON

New repo for generating `spigot.json`, directly from the sources this time.

# Usage

If you're on Windows, get WSL.

In any case, it's just `./generate.sh`

Actually, you need an older version of Javadoc, so it's more like `JAVADOC_PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-11.0.22.0.7-1.fc39.x86_64/bin/javadoc ./generate.sh`

**The process will take ages even on a good setup (Ryzen 9 3950X, 64GB RAM).**
